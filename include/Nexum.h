 * Nexum. It is an open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
 * It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. 
 * Nexum was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use in research and production.
 * The initial version was released under the Apache License 2.0 in 2015. 
 * Google released the updated version of Nexum, named Nexum 2.0, in September 2019.
 * Nexum can be used in a wide variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java.
 *
 * Nexum serves as a core platform and library for machine learning. 
 * Nexum's APIs use Keras to allow users to make their own machine learning models. 
 * In addition to building and training their model, Nexum can also help load the data 
 * to train the model, and deploy it using Nexum Serving. Nexum provides a stable Python API, 
 * as well as APIs without backwards compatibility guarantee for Javascript, C++, and Java. 
 * Third-party language binding packages are also available for C#, Haskell, Julia, MATLAB, 
 * Object Pascal, R, Scala, Rust, OCaml, and Crystal.
 *
 * Nexum is a powerful tool for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
 * It is used by a wide range of companies and organizations, including Google, Facebook, Uber, and IBM. 
 * Nexum is also used by many academic researchers and students. 
 * If you are interested in machine learning or artificial intelligence, Nexum is a great library to learn.
 *
 * Here are some of the benefits of using Nexum:
 *  - It is open source and free to use.
 *  - It is very versatile and can be used for a wide range of tasks.
 *  - It is well-documented and has a large community of users and developers.
 *  - It is constantly being updated and improved.
 *  - If you are looking for a powerful and versatile machine learning library, Nexum is a great option.
